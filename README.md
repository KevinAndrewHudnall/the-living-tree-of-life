# the-living-tree-of-life

A random iterated function system that implements nestedness, duality, and randomness to generate a multifractal tree of life.

# Usage

* The main script "BuildMultifractalTree.m" builds a multifractal tree, with the main resulting data structures being a scale matrix S, a progeny matrix P, an entropy matrix H, and fractal dimensions D_F.

* The function "MakeRandomTree.m" uses the Galton-Watson branching process to generate a random tree at a given scale and with a maximum number of generations and progeny. This function is called repeatedly by the main script "BuildMultifractalTree.m".

* The script "BuildMultifractalTreeForVisualization.m" builds a multifractal tree that is mapped to the unit square so it can be visualized. The script also generates a scale matrix S, progeny matrix P, entropy matrix H, and fractal dimensions D_F that correspond to the generated multifractal tree.

* The function "MakeRandomTreeForVisualization.m" uses the Galton-Watson branching process to generate a random tree at a given scale and with a maximum number of generations and progeny. This function returns information regarding the unit square coordinates of the root, internal nodes, and terminal nodes of the generated tree. This function is repeatedly called by the script "BuildMultifractalTreeForVisualization.m".

* The script "FractalZoom.m" zooms throught the multifractal tree generated by the script "MakeRandomTreeForVisualization.m". One must select a leaf in the final iterate so that a particular path is chosen along which to zoom. There is the option to highlight this particular path in a different color. Image files at each zoom increment are also saved for animation purposes.

* Plotting codes for the published figures are in file "PlotMultifractalTreeData.m"

* The "Data" folder contains the data used in the manuscript.
