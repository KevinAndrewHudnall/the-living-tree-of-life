# the-living-tree-of-life

A random iterated function system that implements nestedness, duality, and randomness to generate a multifractal tree of life

# Usage

* The main script "BuildMultifractalTree.m" builds a multifractal tree, with the main resulting data structures being a scale matrix S, a progeny matrix P, an entropy matrix H, and fractal dimensions D_F

* Plotting codes for figures are in file "PlotMultifractalTreeData"
