% BuildMultifractalTree

% This script builds a multifractal tree by implementing the iterated
% function system. The main objects returned are S, a matrix of scales
% representing all paths in the tree of life; and P, a matrix indicating
% the progeny had by each member at each iteration. Both P and S will have
% as many rows as there are iterates of the system. P will have as many
% columns as there are paths in the second to last iterate since the final
% iterate does not birth any children.

%%%%%%%%%%% Organize Progenies and Leaves into matrices P and S %%%%%%%%%%%

% The number of offspring of every leaf at every iterate has been 
% recorded in Progenies, and likewise the scale of every leaf at every 
% iterate has been recorded in Leaves. These data structures need to be 
% converted to matrices that have N rows and as many columns as there are
% leaves in the final iterate. Doing so will make ancestral relationships
% explicit. Columns of the matrices will then correspond to distinct paths
% through the tree of life. Constructing these matrices requires
% determining how many times each member of every cell except the last of
% Progenies (and Leaves) must be repeated and populated in the matrix.
% Basically, the ancestral relationships are being back constructed using
% the information in Progenies, and then P and S are constructed via these
% ancestral relationships.

% tally holds the number of times each member of each cell of Progenies
% must be repeated in order to form the matrix P
